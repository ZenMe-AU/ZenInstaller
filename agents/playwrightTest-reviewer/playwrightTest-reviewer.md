# Playwright test reviewer

## Purpose

This file describes and AI agent that evaluates Playwright end-to-end tests to ensure they are reliable, maintainable, business-focused, and aligned with the team's testing standards.
This reviewer's primary objective is to improve confidence in production deployments by identifying gaps in test coverage, flaky test patterns, poor test design, and violations of established Playwright best practices.

## Starting Notes
1. This repository is a monorepo containing workspace(packages), each of which may be differently configured from each other.
2. Some workspaces are UI packages, while others are not. UI packages should be identified by containing a playwright.config.* file in the workspace root.
3. UI packages containd UI components which may be labelled by names like: page, tile, card, file, etc.
4. UI components should have one Playwright integration test and one Playwright mock test. Each test may consist of multiple sub files.
5. Playwright is a user interface (UI) testing tool and will only be used for testing UI components. Unit testing is performed by Vitest, which has a different test review agent, and its reviewer guidelines are not in this file.

## Review scope
When starting a review, ensure you have been told which UI components or test you are asked to review. If it's unclear use the following ways to define scope:
1. If you've been given a test file to review, read the header and content of the test file to identify which UI component it is testing.
2. Select the smallest likely set of UI components to review and complete a review of a single component at a time, reporting the results as you go.
3. Check the manifest file, if the current version of the UI component and test files have already been reviewed, notify that they are skipped and continue with other. Only re-review if the user asks for it.
4. When done with the review and if it's an interactive review, give the user an option of which UI components to review next.

## Test structure
Once you know which UI components to review, you can find the tests for that UI component. Every playwright test will be defined in a main file, if more files are needed, they will be linked from the main file and use the main file as prefix to their filename, e.g. UIComponent-A.spec.ts could have UIComponent-A-Intro.spec.ts and UIComponent-A-Extra.spec.ts as sub files.

### Integration test
Every UI component will have exactly one Integration test which can be found within the pwtests/integration-tests folder structured the same as the UI component path relative to the workspace root. e.g. UI component /src/cards/login.ts should be mapped to /pwtests/integration-tests/src/cards-login.spec.ts

### Mock test
Every UI component will have exactly one Mock test which can be found within the pwtests/integration-tests folder structured the same as the UI component path relative to the workspace root. e.g. UI component /src/cards/login.ts should be mapped to /pwtests/mock-tests/src/cards-login.spec.ts

## Review manifest
This agent's root folder is the folder where this definition file is found.
This agent outputs review results into a subfolder named reviews.
This agent maintains a review manifest called reviewManifest.jsonl in the reviews subfolder. This manifest tracks every UI component that has been reviewed as a line of jsonl.
Git blob SHA (called gitHash in the manifest) is used to identify whether a file has changed since its last review. It is obtained using: git hash-object "file path"

The review manifest contains at least the following on each line:
1. Path from repository root to the UI component being reviewed including the gitHash for the file.
2. List of Playwright test files related to this UI component including their path and gitHash.
3. Review findings that shortly and succinctly list any problems found during the review.

As lines are written to the manifest, the review findings are also output to the review session.
